# Machine_learning_models_regression


*CALIFORNIA HOUSE PRICE data was used in this study.

*Since the data is clean, no preprocessing is required.

*The aim is to experience the regression models available in the sklearn library.

*The models used are:

* LinearRegression
* Ridge Regression 
* KernelRidge Regression
* GaussianProcess Regression
* SVR (Support vector regression)
* DecisionTree Regression
* PLS Regression
* AdaBoost Regression
* KNeighbors Regression
* MLP Regression
* RandomForest Regression

*MAE, R2, MSE values were examined.

*R2 and MAE values were visualized with the plt function from the matplotlib library.
